Transcription of what is said on the phone, then summary of all the client's important information along with a rating of the agent's skills + what improvements can be done

Launching the program opens an app in which you can setup the parameters for the vocal transcription. You also need to setup which microphone it will use (default is a virtual audio cable used to test the program)

The program keeps track of the ratings you get. Every time the button "play" is pressed, it considers it to be a new call

I tried to make it work with two separate audio sources (to mimic a call center in which the client and the operator have separate sources) but as of now it doesn't work properly.
